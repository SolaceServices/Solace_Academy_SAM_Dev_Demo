# Already configured your environment?

## 1. Want to skip doing it again? Run the setup.sh script

```
cd ./400-Gateways
source ./400-setup.sh
```

## 2. Opened a new terminal?

Anytime you open a new terminal, you will have to navigate to the sam dir and activate the python virtual environment

```
cd ./400-Gateways/sam
source .venv/bin/activate
sam run
```
