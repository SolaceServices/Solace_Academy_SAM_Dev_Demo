# Solace_Academy_SAM_Demo

## Explain that each directory is an independent instance of SAM that is configured to pick up where the last course left off

## Explain that each directory has a "xxx-env-setup.md" file that must be followed before starting the course

<!-- add href to the readme of each directory so they can navigate there directly -->
